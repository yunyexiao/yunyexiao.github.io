# 11. Machine Learning System Design

## 11.1 Error Matrics for Skewed Classes
For binary classification problems, there is an error matric called *Precision/Recall* matric. Suppose there are two actual classes 0 and 1. When the actual class is 1, and if the predicted class is also 1, then it is called *true positive (tp)*, else *false negitive (fn)*. When the actual class is 0, and if the predicted class is 1, then it is called *false positive (fp)*, else *true negitive (tn)*. Here are some matrics called *precision rate (P)*, *recall rate (R)*, and *F score (F)*:

$$ P = \frac{tp}{tp + fp} $$

$$ R = \frac{tp}{tp + fn} $$

$$ F = \frac{2PR}{P+R} $$

The greater the F score we can get, the better.

## 11.2 Large Data Rationale
* To avoid high bias problems, use a learning algorithm with many features.
* To avoid high variance problems, use a very large training set.

~~It seems that these points above have been covered in previous videos.~~
