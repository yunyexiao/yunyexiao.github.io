# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Concepts
* Definition of Machine Learning: Tom Mitchell (1998): A program is said to *learn* from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

* Supervised Learning: right answers were given.
* Unsupervised Learning: untagged dataset was given.

* Regression: predict *continuous* valued output.
* Classification: predict *discrete* valued output.

## 1.2 Unsupervised Learning
Given an untagged dataset and cluster them.

Applications:
* Organize computing clusters.
* Social network analysis.
* Market segmentation.
* Astronomical data analysis.
